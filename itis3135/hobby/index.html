                Track &amp; Field can look extremely intimidating from what is seen on the Olympics but there is a spot for everyone. It has a total of 48 events, 24 for men and 24 for female. 
                These 48 events are then broken down even further into different categories making it on of the most flexible sports. Short distance, long distance, jumps, and throwing are the four 
                main categories of events that are seen in track. When you start out try each one and see which one you like the best.

            <h3>Background on Track</h3>
            <p>
                Track has been around forever, created back in the 700 B.C by the Ancient Greeks who wanted to show of their athletic abilities. When it was first created there was only a handful of events
                including short sprints, javelin, shot put, and long jump. Over the thousands of years that the sport has been evolving they have added all of the events that we now see at all meets. If you ever
                get the opportunity to try it I highly encourage you too.

            <h2>Danielle's Track Background</h2>
            <p>
                Hey everyone! My name is Danielle Hazlewood and I feel in love with track my freshman year of highschool. Growing up I was always in sports whether it was gymnastics or competitive cheerleading. My
                running career started in middle school with cross country but I was never the biggest fan of long distance. When I started track freshman year I was set on competing in pole vault and that was it for me. 
                Little did I know my coach, Coach Johnson, would forever change my life by getting me to compete in triple jump and high jump. I competed in both outdoor and indoor season throughout my time with Lake Norman. 
                My first three years of my career was just the two events until a new coach came in my senior year and begged me to do new events. I was able to compete in the 55M hurdles, 100M hurdles, and 4x200 relay. Sadly, after high school   
                I retired from all sports due to injuries but I help coach with Mooresville High School and AAU when work allows it.

            </figure>
            <p>
                During my time with the Lake Norman track program I was able to obtain several awards and achievements. All four years I was awarded the field MVP award and attended 2 NCHSAA state meets and 4 regional meets for my area.   
                I hold two school records and the second runner up in 3 other events. I pushed myself to become the best female field athlete that has gone through my school in several years. While my time with Lake Norman was cut short due to    
                covid I am eternally grateful for the opportunity that I had with them.

            <h2>Track &amp; Field Seasons</h2>
            <h3>Indoor</h3>
            <p>
                The first season that track has in what we call indoor season. This season goes from November to February. This season can be tough because you are training outside in all of the elements that winter wants to throw at you. While we do   
                train outside we compete inside, hence the name indoor. For running events, you will compete on a 200 meter long track with all other events taking place on the inside of the track. Also, with indoor the short sprint events like the 100 meter is turned into a 55 meter race.
                Indoor is so much fun because in my experience it was a smaller team which allowed us to be closer with teammates and more time with coaches. 
            </p>
            <h3>Outdoor</h3>
            <p>
                The second season for track is the Outdoor season. This season is from February to June and is our longest season. Outdoor is just like it sounds with both training and meets on an outdoor track. This track is 400M long giving it 4 different stretches, 2 straight and 2 curved.   
                All event are in intervals of 100 meters of distance. This season is long but flies by in a blink of an eye. No feeling beats running in the sun with everyone cheering you on.

            <h2>Where Can You Run</h2>
            <p>
                Running is never defined by where you run but how you feel with it. If you want a true dedicated track you can find one at your local school, just check on there website before you visit. Gym facilities like the YMCA may have an indoor track above a basketball field but it is going to  
                be a 200 meters long or less. The only different other than the distance is going to be the material that is used for the track. Unless you are in a true indoor track facilities may use a foamy pad for the track where outside tracks are made of a more spongy rubber material. If you want to do field 
                events it can be a little more challenging. I would recommend finding a coach in the area because most facilities do not keep the tools needed unlocked and they might have connects to place that does. Now, if a track of any kind is inaccessible there is no worry because you can run anywhere you please.    
                Thats the great thing about running, there is no limit on where you cannot run.

            <h2>How to get Involved</h2>
            <p>
                The best way to get involved with track if you are in school is to join the team. North Carolina middle schools tend to not have a track team so there are no cuts when you get to high school. You might not be able to run in a meet right away but do not give up on yourself right away. If you are out of school 
                joining a group in the area is a good way to get connected with people who also enjoy the sport. Getting started on the journey is the hardest thing to do. Once you are surrounded by other people to push you it just helps the climb and keeps the motivation going.

            <h2>Why Track &amp; Field</h2>
            <p>
                There has been a long standing discussion about running because you either love it or hate it. Running is a great tool to have because it carries so many benefits. It is a great way to stay fit and get cardio in.    
                Running, especially on a track team, also adds a family around yourself and running. It can be so difficult to start running on your own because it is all up to you to stay accountable. With a team you have people   
                around to keep everyone motivated. Running against teammates at practice or timing yourself allows you to set a goal and reach it. Some goals you can hit faster than others and there is always room to improve. There may always be the   
                best in an event but there is no cap for how good you can become it is all up to yourself.
            </p>

            <p>
              The blessing for track is that there is no limits on hoe slow or fast you may be. Whether you run a 15 minute mile or 5 minutes we are all doing the same thing, working out and having fun. So often when I run I find myself in such
              a state of peace that it feels unreal. Why not try it just once, we only live for a small amount of time and you never know when our time is up.
