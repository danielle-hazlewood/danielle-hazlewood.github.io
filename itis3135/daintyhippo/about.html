        <img src="images/family.PNG" alt="my_family">
        <p>75 years ago a dream was born when my grandfather decided to create a Christmas tree farm as a high school FFA project. When he was drafted into World War 2 during high school the trees continued to grow until he came home and sold his first tree. When our family lost him before the 2005 season my uncle took over the farm and his dream has continue in his memory. Every year, starting on November 26th, families come onto our beautiful land and pick the perfect tree for their family. The hippos facts are a little random but growing up I always knew random hippo facts and my uncle started to include them around the farm!</p>
        <p>We over a variety of different trees ranging in different species, furs, pines, and spruces, and so many different heights. Come and choose your perfect tree with your family and learn about hippos!</p>
