            <textarea id="academic-background" required>After graduating high school in 2023, I joined Mitchell Community College to study for a general transfer degree, Associate in Arts. I was able to finish early due to dual enrollment in high school leaving me to graduate in May of 2024. I choose UNC Charlotte to stay close to home, especially after losing my father back in April.

            <textarea id="background-web-development" required>Honestly, I never really looked into web development due to the lack of resources and time. While at Mitchell and in high school I worked full time, sometimes even overtime, which left little time for anything outside of school and work. I have worked primarily with Python, Java, and MySQL.</textarea>
