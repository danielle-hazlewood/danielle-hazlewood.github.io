        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I was born and raised in Mooresville, North Carolina, about 35 minutes without traffic from Charlotte.  </li>
            <li><b>Professional Background:</b> I have been able to work on my family's farm working with Christmas trees, hay, and livestock. On top of that, I have been in management for 3 years in the restaurant industry. I also became a landlord as of early last year.</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b> After graduating high school in 2023, I joined Mitchell Community College to study for a general transfer degree, Associate in Arts. I was able to finish early due to dual enrollment in high school leaving me to graduate in May of 2024. I choose UNC Charlotte to stay close to home, especially after losing my father back in April. I am a junior studying Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity. </li>
            <li><b>Background in this Subject:</b> Honestly, I never really looked into web development due to the lack of resources and time. While at Mitchell and in high school I worked full time, sometimes even overtime, which left little time for anything outside of school and work. I have worked primarily with Python, Java, and MySQL.</li>
            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> MacOS</li>
            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3135 Web-Based Application Design and Development:</b> Required, I am interested in learning about web development as I have never done it before.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3200 Intro to Info Security &amp; Priv:</b> Required, I want to go into law enforcement when I graduate but I wanted to learn something that I can help me specialize in a unit when I go in so I choose computer science. </li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 2175 Logic and Algorithms:</b> Required, I dont know much about what this class entails.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 2181 Introduction to Computer Systems:</b> Required, Learned on the first day that this class is about the middle man between code and the computer components so it sounds interesting.</li>
                    <li><b>MATH 2164 Matrices &amp; Linear Algebra:</b> Required, I also loved doing matrices in other classes so im exited to go more in depth with it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</b> If I donâ€™t have a hoodie on, I have a tattoo of 4 trees and the date we lost my grandfather on my bicep.</li>
            <li><b>I'd also like to Share:</b> I am super quiet when I first meet people, but once I get comfortable, I never stop talking.</li>
        </ul>
