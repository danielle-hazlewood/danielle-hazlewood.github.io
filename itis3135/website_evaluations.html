            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a></h3>
            <p>Apple's website provides a modern feel to their products. The way the website is set up it feels like a luxury experience while also allowing the customer to see all the information they provide.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple using contrast to their advantage. On the home page they use the colors of the phone as the background but keep it lighter in order to make them stand out. </li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> All the font sizes and placements are relative to the block that they have each of their products in. They also keep the paragraphs short and straight to the point keeping the page uncrowded.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Apple uses boxes to keep organized and all relevant information together. While in the smaller boxes there is different information between them the separation allows for an easy understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The proximity of the elements are spaced the same on all sides and across the website. This gives a balanced website for the user to look at. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://badhtml.com/" target="_blank">Bad HTML</a></h3>
            <p>Bad HTML is a website that shows all the common errors that are made in HTML and CSS to bring awareness for those who see it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> There is a lot of contrast going on but most of it is low. While yes you can read everything pretty well the colors crash with other creating a distraction where your eyes just jump all over the page./li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The design pattern stays pretty constant on the color scheme, font, and style. The sparkles at the bottom and the stars falling are random and lead to a change in design.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment of the borders around the text match on all pages but they overlap. This overlap leads to a crowded looking page and makes the boxes harder to distinguish.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The proximity of everything is equal on all websites. While overall the page is crazy all similar and non-similar concepts are kept together in a way.</li>
