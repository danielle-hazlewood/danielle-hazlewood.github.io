        <p>Hey, my name is Lily Darr I am from Mooresville, NC and I am currently a student at Rowan Cabarrus Community College. I want to share my journey with y'all and hope to see you in my chair at some point!! ✂️✂️
            I currently live in Troutman Nc, and have been for 5 years now. I go to school in Kannapolis and take clients from 8-12 Wednesday through Friday. I am also currently working at my future salon home in Huntersville NC, 
            as a receptionist and when graduated be behind my own chair there as well. I am very motivated, passionate, and make every client that sits in the chair my personally responsibility to have them leave with gorgeous hair.</p>
